1.  Introduction

   Metaverse introduces the concept of a persistent virtual space of
   everyday life as platform-agnostic digital space.  It is an
   interconnected and limitless virtual world populated by an extension
   of physical identities, a digital twin of the physical world.

   Metaverse can be defined as the 3D generation of the Internet
   accessible via new non-intrusive interfaces (e.g. holographics) and
   making use of new types of information (e.g. haptic, temperature,
   smell, emotions, digital transactions) that can be exchanged between
   people, simulated users, and cyber-physical systems, while preserving
   data privacy.

   Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies have
   enormous potential in many different fields.  Cloud based AR/VR are
   evolving since AR/VR applications combine high bandwidth demands and
   high sensitivity to latency and dropped packets.  There are elaborate
   solutions for dealing with bandwidth limitations, network congestion,
   lossy transport protocols, and the ever growing size of video data,
   for instance:

   *  [MPTCP] and [MPQUIC] are the expansions of [TCP] and [QUIC] in
      order to dispatch packets over multiple paths to maximize
      throughput.

   *  Adaptive Streaming approaches based on HTTP/2 aim to improve the
      viewport quality of immersive videos by refining the tiles
      delivery.

   But these solutions have limitations when we consider their
   application to the Metaverse virtual space.

2.  Requirements

   [I-D.han-iccrg-arvr-transport-problem] started to analyze the
   requirements of VR and AR to networking, especially to transport
   protocol.  As emerging technology, VR and AR bring up a lot of
   challenges to technologies such as information display, image
   processing, fast computing and networking.  Some of the requirements
   are:

   *  Low latency and High-Speed transport to reach services in one-hop
      and for real-time user interactions

   *  Intelligent control and SLA real-time monitoring to convey the
      traffic and manage network resources and source/route reselection

   *  Decentralization and Edge Services by positioning the data close
      to the user

   *  Reducing data sizes through resolution changes, compression, and
      more efficient encodings

3.  Gap Analysis

   Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is an adaptive bitrate
   streaming technique that enables high quality streaming of media
   content over HTTP.  Typically, the DASH client adaptively requests
   small chunks of media based on the available bandwidth and other
   resources.  This client-pull technology has proven to be more
   flexible, firewall-friendly, and CDN scalable than server-push
   technologies.  However, there is less control given the decentralized
   and client-driven nature of DASH, which introduces new challenges for
   them to offer a consistent and possibly higher quality of service for
   the new Metaverse experience.

   The Metaverse immersive space require intensive computational
   resources to render and display the video frames in a short motion-
   to-photon time so that people can obtain a real-time experience.  VR
   and AR on the Edge Cloud is becoming a promising technique, which
   enables users to play high quality VR games without equipping high
   end gaming PCs.

   With Metaverse, it is expected that a big amount of data can be
   exchanged between autonomous networks over untrusted channels.  To
   ensure security, privacy, and trust among stakeholders, Blockchain
   can be employed to allow intelligent resource management, user access
   control, audibility, and chronology in stored transactions.

4.  Solutions

   Some initiatives are already dealing with related issues in IETF:

   *  Network of Information defines an Information-Centric Networking
      (ICN) with named "information objects", e.g. media contents, as
      the central concept as opposed to a physical computer, or "node".
      In ICN approaches, the principal paradigm is not host-to-host
      communication as in the current Internet architecture ([RFC7927]).
      The increasing demand for highly scalable and efficient
      distribution of content has motivated the development of
      architectures that focus on information objects, their properties,
      and receiver interest in the network to achieve efficient and
      reliable distribution of such objects.

   *  QuicR defines a Media Delivery Protocol over QUIC and its
      architecture [I-D.jennings-moq-quicr-arch] uses similar concepts
      and delivery mechanisms to those used by CDN and named objects.
      However there are fundamental characteristics that QuicR provides
      for ultra low latency delivery, by leveraging the characteristics
      of QUIC protocol.

   *  Low Latency Low Loss Scalable throughput technology (L4S) can
      significantly reduce lag in an interactive cloud-based video game
      ([I-D.ietf-tsvwg-l4s-arch]).  L4S relies on ECN (Explicit
      Congestion Notification) in the IP header to indicate queue build-
      up in the radio access network to the application.

   *  The APplication-aware Networking (APN) aims to develop a framework
      to enable fine-granularity network service provisioning (traffic
      operations) within the network domain(s) that supports APN
      ([I-D.li-apn-framework]).  APN aims to use the ability to apply
      policies to traffic flows entering into the infrastructure (APN
      domain).  In modern networks, where things such as deterministic
      networking and networking slicing are required, there is a
      requirement for more functionality than QoS can provide.

   *  Glass to Glass Internet Ecosystem (GGIE) was presented few years
      ago and aimed to leverage IPv6 Glass to Glass.  End to end
      Internet digital video ecosystem focusing on all phases of the
      video life cycle: Capture-Edit-Package-Distribute-Find-Watch.  The
      network is assumed to be IPv6-only.  More details can be found in
      [I-D.deen-daigle-ggie].
