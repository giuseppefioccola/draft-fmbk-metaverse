1.  Introduction

   The Web today essentially represents a data-centric application
   layer: data named by URLs is manipulated with Representational State
   Transfer (REST) primitives.  However, the semantic gap with the
   underlying host-oriented transport is significant.

   The interest in “the Metaverse” suggests that the end-user experience
   of the Web will evolve towards an always-on eXtended Reality (XR).
   Metaverse introduces the concept of a persistent virtual space of
   everyday life as platform-agnostic digital space.  It is an
   interconnected and limitless virtual world populated by an extension
   of physical identities, a digital twin of the physical world.
   Metaverse can be seen as the 3D generation of the Internet accessible
   via new non-intrusive interfaces (e.g. holographics) and making use
   of new types of information (e.g. haptic, temperature, smell,
   emotions, digital transactions) that can be exchanged between people,
   simulated users, and cyber-physical systems, while preserving data
   privacy.

   For this reason, the Metaverse should be considered not as an
   application of the current network, but an evolution of the network
   itself, reducing rather than widening the gap between network
   architecture and application semantics.

   The ICN architecture is discussed in this document since it allows to
   achieve the integration of application and network layers with less
   overhead, low latency, better security, and more disruption tolerance
   suitable to diverse uses cases.

2.  Requirements

   [I-D.han-iccrg-arvr-transport-problem] started to analyze the
   requirements of VR and AR to networking, especially to transport
   protocol.  As emerging technology, VR and AR bring up a lot of
   challenges to technologies such as information display, image
   processing, fast computing and networking.  Some of the requirements
   are:

   *  Low latency and High-Speed transport to reach services in one-hop
      and for real-time user interactions

   *  Intelligent control and SLA real-time monitoring to convey the
      traffic and manage network resources and source/route reselection

   *  Decentralization and Edge Services by positioning the data close
      to the user

   *  Reducing data sizes through resolution changes, compression, and
      more efficient encodings

3.  Gap Analysis

   There are elaborate solutions for dealing with bandwidth limitations,
   network congestion, lossy transport protocols, and the ever growing
   size of video data, to address the above requirements, for instance:

   *  MPTCP[RFC8684] and MPQUIC[I-D.ietf-quic-multipath] are the
      expansions of TCP[RFC9293] and QUIC[RFC9000] in order to dispatch
      packets over multiple paths to maximize throughput.

   *  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) aim to improve the
      viewport quality of immersive videos by refining the tiles
      delivery.  But client-driven nature of DASH introduces less
      control on the server side.

   *  Media over QUIC (MoQ) ([I-D.ietf-moq-requirements]) and extensions
      such as QuicR ([I-D.jennings-moq-proto]) use similar concepts and
      delivery mechanisms to those used by CDN and named objects.  There
      are fundamental characteristics that QuicR provides for ultra low
      latency delivery, by leveraging the characteristics of QUIC
      protocol.

   *  The APplication-aware Networking (APN) aims to develop a framework
      to enable fine-granularity network service provisioning (traffic
      operations) within the network domain(s) that supports APN
      ([I-D.li-apn-framework]).  APN aims to use the ability to apply
      policies to traffic flows entering into the infrastructure.  In
      modern networks, where things such as deterministic networking and
      networking slicing are required, there is a requirement for more
      functionality than QoS can provide.

   But these solutions have limitations when we consider the Metaverse
   virtual space.  In all of these approaches, the Metaverse is
   considered as an overlay application with corresponding
   infrastructure dependencies, but this increases the current gaps (and
   resulting costs and technical complexity) between distributed
   applications and the underlying network architecture.

   It would be better to assume information-centric system where most
   applications participate in granular 3D content exchange, context-
   aware integration with the physical world, and other Metaverse-
   relevant services. “The Metaverse” is an information-centric concept
   that will become synonymous with the network itself.

   The Information-Centric Networking (ICN) introduces named
   “information objects”, e.g. media contents, as the central concept as
   opposed to a physical computer, or "node".  In ICN approaches, the
   principal paradigm is not host-to-host communication as in the
   current Internet architecture ([RFC7927]).  The increasing demand for
   highly scalable and efficient distribution of content has motivated
   the development of architectures that focus on information objects,
   their properties, and receiver interest in the network to achieve
   efficient and reliable distribution of such objects.

4.  ICN technical challenges

   Many applications already work with data-oriented paradigms.  Mapping
   them to a host-centric network model creates complexities and
   robustness issues, which can be addressed with a native ICN approach.

   The overlay approach to deal with real-time interactive media adds
   significant complexity.  It is needed a fine-grained, hierarchical
   media exchange for low-latency interactive communication that enables
   scalable multi-destination distribution, and in-network replication
   and transformation that exposes object hierarchy for fine grained
   access and security.

   Since the Metaverse is an extension of the Web into immersive XR
   modalities that are often aligned with physical space, leveraging ICN
   concepts provides support for decentralized publishing, content
   interoperability and co-existence, based on general building blocks
   and not within separated application silos as today’s initial
   prototypes.

   There are four ICN capabilities critical to Metaverse concepts:

   *  scalable and robust multi-destination communication, overcoming IP
      multicast challenges such as inter-domain routing, scalability,
      and routing communication overhead;

   *  leveraging wireless broadcast to support shared local views and
      low-latency interactivity;

   *  privacy, selective attention, content filtering, and autonomous
      interactions, as well as ownership and control on the publishing
      side;

   *  supporting in-network processing for objects replication and
      transformation.
