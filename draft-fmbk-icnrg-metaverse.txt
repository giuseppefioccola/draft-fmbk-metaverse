1.  Introduction

   The Web today essentially represents a data-centric application
   layer: data named by URLs is manipulated with Representational State
   Transfer (REST) primitives.  However, the semantic gap with the
   underlying host-oriented transport is significant.

   The interest in “the Metaverse” suggests that the end-user experience
   of the Web will evolve towards an always-on eXtended Reality (XR).
   Metaverse introduces the concept of a persistent virtual space of
   everyday life as platform-agnostic digital space.  It is an
   interconnected and limitless virtual world populated by an extension
   of physical identities, a digital twin of the physical world.
   Metaverse can be seen as the 3D generation of the Internet accessible
   via new non-intrusive interfaces (e.g. holographics) and making use
   of new types of information (e.g. haptic, temperature, smell,
   emotions, digital transactions) that can be exchanged between people,
   simulated users, and cyber-physical systems, while preserving data
   privacy.

   Metaverse can also be seen as the next generation of Internet, that
   can be built based on Web 3.0.  The Web 3.0 is an idea for a new
   iteration of the World Wide Web which incorporates concepts such as
   decentralization, trustworthy interactions, peer-to-peer, data
   distribution, decentralized identifiers.  This is something more and
   different from the vision of Metaverse as full Virtual Reality (VR)
   and Augmented Reality (AR).

   For this reason, the Metaverse should be considered not as an
   application of the current network, but an evolution of the network
   itself, reducing rather than widening the gap between network
   architecture and application semantics.

   The ICN architecture is discussed in this document since it allows to
   achieve the integration of application and network layers with less
   overhead, low latency, better security, and more disruption tolerance
   suitable to diverse uses cases.

2.  Requirements

   [I-D.han-iccrg-arvr-transport-problem] started to analyze the
   requirements of VR and AR to networking, especially to transport
   protocol.  As emerging technology, the Metaverse brings up a lot of
   challenges to technologies such as information display, image
   processing, fast computing and networking.  Some of the requirements
   are:

   *  Low latency and High-Speed transport to reach services in one-hop
      and for real-time user interactions

   *  Intelligent control and SLA real-time monitoring to convey the
      traffic and manage network resources and source/route reselection

   *  Decentralization and Edge Services by positioning the data close
      to the user

   *  Reducing data sizes through resolution changes, compression, and
      more efficient encodings

3.  Gap Analysis

   It is known that HTML and HTTP are used to locate a web address, but
   they do not provide a sufficient technological foundation for the
   disparate technologies of the Web 3.0.  In this regard, the
   HyperSpace Transaction Protocol (HSTP), as described by [IEEE-P2874],
   is an evolution of HTTP to connect Metaverse spaces, including all
   data and entities (e.g. physical people, cities, buildings, objects,
   and their digital twins).  It should be able to enable a fully
   augmented experience, bridging Web 3.0 technologies, artificial
   intelligence, blended realities (digital and physical), and
   distributed ledger technologies.  Similarly for HTML, it would evolve
   in the direction of something like HyperSpace Modeling Language
   (HSML).

   Looking at the transport and network layer, there are the same gaps
   which needs to be overcame too.  There are elaborate solutions for
   dealing with bandwidth limitations, network congestion, lossy
   transport protocols, and the ever growing size of video data, to
   address the above requirements, for instance:

   *  MPTCP[RFC8684] and MPQUIC[I-D.ietf-quic-multipath] are the
      expansions of TCP[RFC9293] and QUIC[RFC9000] in order to dispatch
      packets over multiple paths to maximize throughput.

   *  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) aim to improve the
      viewport quality of immersive videos by refining the tiles
      delivery.  But client-driven nature of DASH introduces less
      control on the server side.

   *  Media over QUIC (MoQ) ([I-D.ietf-moq-requirements]) and extensions
      such as QuicR ([I-D.jennings-moq-proto]) use similar concepts and
      delivery mechanisms to those used by CDN and named objects.  There
      are fundamental characteristics that QuicR provides for ultra low
      latency delivery, by leveraging the characteristics of QUIC
      protocol.

   *  The APplication-aware Networking (APN) aims to develop a framework
      to enable fine-granularity network service provisioning (traffic
      operations) within the network domain(s) that supports APN
      ([I-D.li-apn-framework]).  APN aims to use the ability to apply
      policies to traffic flows entering into the infrastructure.  In
      modern networks, where things such as deterministic networking and
      networking slicing are required, there is a requirement for more
      functionality than QoS can provide.

   *  The Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) aims to analyze the
      problem on the edge node, which makes a decision based on the
      metrics of interest, and then steers the traffic to a node that
      serves a service instance.  Indeed, for some services (e.g.  AR/
      VR), the performance experienced by the end users depends on both
      network metrics such as bandwidth and latency, and compute metrics
      such as processing, storage capabilities, and capacity.

   In all of these approaches, the Metaverse is considered as an overlay
   application with corresponding infrastructure dependencies, but this
   increases the current gaps (and resulting costs and technical
   complexity) between distributed applications and the underlying
   network architecture.

   Additionally, it is important to understand which networking
   technology can be aligned with HSTP [IEEE-P2874].  Given that the
   current Internet stack is host driven, it is misaligned with the
   application layer that is data driven.

4.  Solution with an ICN approach

   The Information-Centric Networking (ICN) introduces named information
   objects, e.g. media contents, as the central concept as opposed to a
   physical computer, or node.  In ICN approaches, the principal
   paradigm is not host-to-host communication as in the current Internet
   architecture ([RFC7927]).  The increasing demand for highly scalable
   and efficient distribution of content has motivated the development
   of architectures that focus on information objects, their properties,
   and receiver interest in the network to achieve efficient and
   reliable distribution of such objects.

   Therefore, for the Metaverse, it would be better to assume
   information-centric system where most applications participate in
   granular 3D content exchange, context-aware integration with the
   physical world, and other Metaverse-relevant services.  The
   assumption is that the Metaverse is an information-centric concept
   that will become synonymous with the network itself.

4.1.  Technical challenges

   Many applications already work with data-oriented paradigms.  Mapping
   them to a host-centric network model creates complexities and
   robustness issues, which can be addressed with an ICN oriented
   approach.

   The overlay approach to deal with real-time interactive media adds
   significant complexity.  It is needed a fine-grained, hierarchical
   media exchange for low-latency interactive communication that enables
   scalable multi-destination distribution, and in-network replication
   and transformation that exposes object hierarchy for fine grained
   access and security.

   Since the Metaverse is an extension of the Web into immersive XR
   modalities that are often aligned with physical space, leveraging ICN
   concepts provides support for decentralized publishing, content
   interoperability and co-existence, based on general building blocks
   and not within separated application silos as today’s initial
   prototypes.

   There are four ICN capabilities critical to Metaverse concepts:

   *  scalable and robust multi-destination communication, overcoming IP
      multicast challenges such as inter-domain routing, scalability,
      and routing communication overhead;

   *  leveraging wireless broadcast to support shared local views and
      low-latency interactivity;

   *  privacy, selective attention, content filtering, and autonomous
      interactions, as well as ownership and control on the publishing
      side;

   *  supporting in-network processing for objects replication and
      transformation.

   In addition, the interoperability aspects also need to be
   investigated, and, for example, Hybrid Information-Centric Networking
   (hICN), which implements information-networking functionalities into
   IPv6 ([I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn], can provide a solution.
