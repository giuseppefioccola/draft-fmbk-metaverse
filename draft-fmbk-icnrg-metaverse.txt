1.  Introduction

   "Metaverse" is a place-holder for a range of new technologies and
   experiences that is not particularly well-defined, but some working
   definitions include the notion of shared, interoperable, and
   persistent eXtended Reality (XR).  Whereas initial prototypes and
   blueprints suggest leveraging or extending existing Internet and Web
   protocols, we can already identify gaps with respect to performance
   and scalability, for example as reported by [socialAR-measurements].

   Some of the observed performance problems seem to stem from
   fundamental gaps in today's Internet and Web technologies, for
   example, the lack of scalable and robust multi-destination
   communication and the lack of leveraging computing in the network
   with the required level of flexibility and trustworthiness to provide
   offloading services and to enable the ultra-low latencies that some
   Metaverse applications claim to require.

   Different remedies are being proposed, e.g., providing more (costly)
   deterministic communication services through resource reservation and
   scheduling on the Internet, requiring/enabling the network to
   understand application requirements and to provide corresponding QoS,
   extended overlay infrastructure for reducing latencies for CDN-like
   distribution etc.

   Alternatively, one might also take a more principled approach and do
   not take current design and deployment models as a given, but rather
   take Metaverse as a first candidate proposal for a future web
   infrastructure that enables fine-granular 3D content exchange, rich
   interaction between physical and virtual infrastructure, access to
   static data and dynamic computation results for individual users as
   well as for large user groups without the limitations of today's
   platform- and overlay-based system -- i.e., conceive the Metaverse
   and the future web as a fundamentally information-centric system.

   This Internet draft addresses three aspects:

   1.  the documentation of requirements and observed gaps with the
       current technology stack;

   2.  a discussion of the applicability of different networking and
       distributed computing technologies; and

   3.  an initial discussion of a more fundamental and comprehensive re-
       design of a future web that provides useful services for
       Metaverse systems and beyond.

2.  Requirements

   [I-D.han-iccrg-arvr-transport-problem] started to analyze the
   requirements of VR and AR to networking, especially to transport
   protocol.  As emerging technology, the Metaverse brings up a lot of
   challenges to technologies such as information display, image
   processing, fast computing and networking.  Some of the requirements
   are:

   *  Low latency and High-Speed transport to reach services in one-hop
      and for real-time user interactions

   *  Intelligent control and SLA real-time monitoring to convey the
      traffic and manage network resources and source/route reselection

   *  Decentralization and Edge Services by positioning the data close
      to the user

   *  Reducing data sizes through resolution changes, compression, and
      more efficient encodings

3.  Gap Analysis

   It is known that HTML and HTTP are used to locate a web address, but
   they do not provide a sufficient technological foundation for the
   disparate technologies of the Web 3.0.  In this regard, the
   HyperSpace Transaction Protocol (HSTP), as described by [IEEE-P2874],
   is an evolution of HTTP to connect Metaverse spaces, including all
   data and entities (e.g. physical people, cities, buildings, objects,
   and their digital twins).  It should be able to enable a fully
   augmented experience, bridging Web 3.0 technologies, artificial
   intelligence, blended realities (digital and physical), and
   distributed ledger technologies.  Similarly, HTML would evolve in the
   direction of something like HyperSpace Modeling Language (HSML).

   Looking at the transport and network layer, there are the same gaps
   which needs to be overcame too.  There are elaborate solutions for
   dealing with bandwidth limitations, network congestion, lossy
   transport protocols, and the ever growing size of video data, to
   address the above requirements, for instance:

   *  MPTCP[RFC8684] and MPQUIC[I-D.ietf-quic-multipath] are the
      expansions of TCP[RFC9293] and QUIC[RFC9000] in order to dispatch
      packets over multiple paths to maximize throughput.

   *  Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) aim to improve the
      viewport quality of immersive videos by refining the tiles
      delivery.  But client-driven nature of DASH introduces less
      control on the server side.

   *  Media over QUIC (MoQ) ([I-D.ietf-moq-requirements]) and extensions
      such as QuicR ([I-D.jennings-moq-proto]) use similar concepts and
      delivery mechanisms to those used by CDN and named objects.  There
      are fundamental characteristics that QuicR provides for ultra low
      latency delivery, by leveraging the characteristics of QUIC
      protocol.

   *  The APplication-aware Networking (APN) aims to develop a framework
      to enable fine-granularity network service provisioning (traffic
      operations) within the network domain(s) that supports APN
      ([I-D.li-apn-framework]).  APN aims to use the ability to apply
      policies to traffic flows entering into the infrastructure.  In
      modern networks, where things such as deterministic networking and
      networking slicing are required, there is a requirement for more
      functionality than QoS can provide.

   *  The Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) aims to analyze the
      problem on the edge node, which makes a decision based on the
      metrics of interest, and then steers the traffic to a node that
      serves a service instance.  Indeed, for AR/VR services, the
      performance experienced by the end users depends on both network
      metrics such as bandwidth and latency, and compute metrics such as
      processing, storage capabilities, and capacity.

   In all of these approaches, the Metaverse is considered as an overlay
   application with corresponding infrastructure dependencies, but this
   increases the current gaps (and resulting costs and technical
   complexity) between distributed applications and the underlying
   network architecture.

   Additionally, it is important to understand which networking
   technology can be aligned with HSTP [IEEE-P2874].  Given that the
   current Internet stack is host driven, it is misaligned with the
   application layer that is data driven.

4.  Solution with an ICN approach

   The Information-Centric Networking (ICN) introduces named information
   objects, e.g. media contents, as the central concept as opposed to a
   physical computer, or node ([RFC7927]).  In ICN approaches, the
   principal paradigm is not host-to-host communication as in the
   current Internet architecture.  The increasing demand for highly
   scalable and efficient distribution of content has motivated the
   development of architectures that focus on information objects, their
   properties, and receiver interest in the network to achieve efficient
   and reliable distribution of such objects.

   Therefore, for the Metaverse, it would be better to assume
   information-centric system where most applications participate in
   granular 3D content exchange, context-aware integration with the
   physical world, and other Metaverse-relevant services.  The
   assumption is that the Metaverse is an information-centric concept
   that will become synonymous with the network itself.

4.1.  Technical challenges

   Many applications already work with data-oriented paradigms.  Mapping
   them to a host-centric network model creates complexities and
   robustness issues, which can be addressed with an ICN oriented
   approach.

   The overlay approach to deal with real-time interactive media adds
   significant complexity.  It is needed a fine-grained, hierarchical
   media exchange for low-latency interactive communication that enables
   scalable multi-destination distribution, and in-network replication
   and transformation that exposes object hierarchy for fine grained
   access and security.

   Since the Metaverse is an extension of the Web into immersive XR
   modalities that are often aligned with physical space, leveraging ICN
   concepts provides support for decentralized publishing, content
   interoperability and co-existence, based on general building blocks
   and not within separated application silos as today’s initial
   prototypes.

   There are four ICN capabilities critical to Metaverse concepts:

   *  scalable and robust multi-destination communication, overcoming IP
      multicast challenges such as inter-domain routing, scalability,
      and routing communication overhead;

   *  leveraging wireless broadcast to support shared local views and
      low-latency interactivity;

   *  privacy, selective attention, content filtering, and autonomous
      interactions, as well as ownership and control on the publishing
      side;

   *  supporting in-network processing for objects replication and
      transformation.

   In addition, the interoperability aspects also need to be
   investigated, and, for example, Hybrid Information-Centric Networking
   (hICN), which implements information-networking functionalities into
   IPv6 ([I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn], can provide a solution.

   It would be theoretically possible to leverage the solutions
   mentioned in the previous section in order to reach the above ICN
   oriented capabilities.  But a systemic approach would be highly
   desirable in the longer term.
